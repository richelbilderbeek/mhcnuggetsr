\title{Predict the half maximal inhibitory concentration (aka IC50) (in nM)
for one or more peptides as saved in a file.
Each peptide must be 15 amino acids at
most (use \link{predict_ic50s} to predict the IC50s for longer peptides)}
\usage{

  mhcnuggets_options,
  peptides_path,

\arguments{
\item{mhcnuggets_options}{options to run MHCnuggets with,
as can be created by \link{create_mhcnuggets_options}.}

\item{peptides_path}{the path to the peptides}

\item{mhcnuggets_output_filename}{path to a temporary file to write
the MHCnuggets results to. This file will be deleted at the end of
the function if it passes successfully.}

\item{verbose}{set to \link{TRUE} for more debug information}
